title: "Elm and Rust"

The year 2020 is notable for me as a programmer because I finally began to explore new languages again after more than three years of focusing mostly on JavaScript.

Several years ago, upon completion of quite a challenging project, I was fatigued and felt that I no longer can keep up with the dynamic evolution of the variety of technologies around.

So I obstructed myself from the distraction. At least I thought so by choosing to approach a quiet harbor of JavaScript - still a very dynamic language that is improving and expanding at an incredible speed and has found application literally everywhere.

I thought that will be enough for me, and that it's better to be very sharp in one function than not-that-sharp in multiple. After a while, I started to understand that it was a mistake that leads to a pit of losing confidence in the ability to solve various problems better.

Elm and Rust.

Although not always you can find practical application, these tools raise my excitement when you realize there is no pressure from the work perspective â€“ your work turns back your hobby with the forgotten feeling of doing it just from inner motivation like ten years ago. Funny, familiar forgotten feeling.

I like the fact that Rust is still in the early stages of developing its ecosystem and community, that Elm is probably too distinct to be widely adopted by the web development audience.

All this gives me the feeling of delight form the simple process of self-education, trying new things, contemplating.
